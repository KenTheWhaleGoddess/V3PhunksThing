### TestSuite is a testing suite written with TruffleJS / MochaJS.
Documentation of the framework can be found here: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript/ 

### This is work in progress and will likely update to test and highlight specific use cases.
contracts/* contains modified versions of the developed code with certain additional features or visibility enabled.

### Any changes to functions should pre propagated to the Contracts copy too (for now).


### How to: 

cd into TestSuite folder

npm install
truffle develop
truffle compile
truffle migrate
truffle test

simple :)
